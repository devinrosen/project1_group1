# Residential Real Estate vs Supply, Inflation, and Interest Rate

Our goal is to determine how the value of residential real estate relates to supply, inflation, and interest rate.  Additionally, we will compare real estate returns to the returns of the  S&P 500 and XLRE (Real Estate Select Sector).

## Objectives
We intend to identify ideal periods to transact residential real estate based on valuation, inflation, and interest rate.
