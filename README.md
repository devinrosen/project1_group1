# Residential Real Estate vs Supply, Inflation, and Interest Rate

## Description
Our goal is to determine how the value of residential real estate relates to supply, inflation, and interest rate.  Based on these economic factors, can we discern optimal periods for buying or selling residential real estate for investment purposes.  Additionally, we will explore how real estate compares to equities by measuring residential real estate values to the S&P 500 and XLRE (Real Estate Select Sector).

## Objectives
 - We intend to identify ideal periods to transact residential real estate based on valuation, inflation, and interest rate.
 - We intend to compare residential real estate returns to the S&P 500 and XLRE for investment purposes.
